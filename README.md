# Horesion-Homepage
Homework for week 1

The main changes I made to the webpage are:
I added an alt tag to every picture to improve accessibility guidelines
I made the links so they all link to the proper section of the document
I changed the h tag in the footer from h3 to h4 so the h tags were in sequential order
I added basic comments to the CSS document 
I changed all of the non-semantic container elements into semantic elements
